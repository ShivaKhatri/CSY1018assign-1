# Begning of my portfolio site
Before starting to code for my site, I searched and viewed other portfolios and got some idea how to design my site. Then I noticed many of those sites had simple but beautiful designs, had links to their social media accounts on the footer. This gave me some ideas about how I am going to design and build my site. The websites which inspired me are:

# Development of my portfolio site
After having few ideas I started to develop my site. First I made some sketches and then wire frame and then started coding for the site. Throught the process of developing I went to [w3school](https://www.w3schools.com/) and [csstricks](https://css-tricks.com/)for the idea of my designs. 
## Sketches
First I made a basic sketch of my **home**, **curriculum vitae**, **BIO** and **contact** page. A logo at the top left corner of the site and a hovering navigation bar. A picture at the center of the page. Social media links at the bottom of the page with hovering effect. For **BIO** page its just simple design a photo and description about me. Then on the **cv** there are tables and a div which contains my formal information.**contact** page has  a form and below it some info about my loaction and email address.
#### Home and Bio:

## Wireframes
After drawing some sketches I started to build wireframes and the first design was my final design. There are place holders for content. I designed wireframes for both mobile and desktop view.

## First look
After I finished building wire frames, I started coding for my site. I mostly used flex to mangage the position of my divs.

## Final look
I mainly used divs and flex property to manage the content of my site. I made a logo and positioned it at top left corner of my site. Then I added some links at the footer with image icons. The footer was always moving towards the top of the site and that was due to lack of content and improper tags which I corrected at the end. I used **@media** to make the content responsive according to the screen size of the device. Flex has been used widely to arrange the **divs**. The pages are simple designs and have simple codes. 
#### Desktop View
![home](https://github.com/ShivaKhatri/CSY1018assign-1/blob/master/images/readme/Final_site/desktop/home.png)
There is a picture of me and welcome message below it. The navagation bar has a hovering effect and it has transation so the hovering effect won't look so sudden.

The bio page has a picture of me pointing towards the information about me. This page is simple and just has my picture and information about me.
![cv](https://github.com/ShivaKhatri/CSY1018assign-1/blob/master/images/readme/Final_site/desktop/cv.png)
Here two table have been used to give information about me and the row  has a hover effect and it has a transation delay so the hovering effect won't look so sudden.
![contact](https://github.com/ShivaKhatri/CSY1018assign-1/blob/master/images/readme/Final_site/desktop/contact.png)
Form tag have been used on this page to create the forms. There is a heading on the top so the users know  that they are on contact page.
There is link to my email address so people can reach and contact me or simply they can fill the form and contact me.
#### Mobile View

## Good practices
The design of my webpage have been made as simple as possible. The navigation bar is at the top and is simple and user can easily navigate through any pages on my site. There are two links linked on the word *formal* and *informal* so people can reach to the respective site and don't necessarily need to click on the navigation bar to reach to those sites.
I have taken ideas from different sites and then written codes myself to minimize the chance of plagiarism and have been credited or refrenced on this file.
### Performance
I tested my site with [pingdom](https://tools.pingdom.com/) and it showed my site was faster that 98% of other site tested on it.
