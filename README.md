# Begning of my portfolio site
Before starting to code for my site, I searched and viewed other portfolios and got some idea how to design my site. Then I noticed many of those sites had simple but beautiful designs, had links to their social media accounts on the footer. This gave me some ideas about how I am going to design and build my site. The websites which inspired me are:

# Development of my portfolio site
After having few ideas I started to develop my site. First I made some sketches and then wire frame and then started coding for the site.
## sketches
First I made a basic sketch of my **home**, **curriculum vitae**, **BIO** and **contact** page. A logo at the top left corner of the site and a hovering navigation bar. A picture at the center of the page. Social media links at the bottom of the page with hovering effect. For **BIO** page its just simple design a photo and description about me. Then on the **cv** there are tables and a div which contains my formal information.**contact** page has  a form and below it some info about my loaction and email address.
