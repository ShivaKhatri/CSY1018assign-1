           HI! My name is Shiva Thapa. I am 20 years old. I live in Kathmandu,Nepal. I am a biginner programmer who enjoys learning new things. I am currently a student at university of Northamton. <br>The first type of computer I owned was a keyboard gameing console(subor). Then I saw a real computer in grade 3 beacuse before that I was in village area and a civil war was going on. The first application I ever used was paint through which I learned to use mouse and point at files.
           Unfortunately my academic journy with computer started only at grade 7 and lasted till grade 8. Then I got re united with computer feild in grade 11 and then I got along with it and was facinated by the wonders of programming world.<br>
           Then after highschool I learned basic programming and that gave me a kick start towards programming field. Now I am enjoying studying programming and have taken part in some projects provided by the university.
